My repository consists of one main folder which is the Portfolio folder. <br/>
  In my Portfolio folder, it has 3 folders (First Grading, Midterms, and Finals). <br/>
    Inside my 3 folders (First Grading, Midterms, and Finals) have another 2 folder (Laboratory and Lecture) that consists all of my activities from Day 1 of this First Semester. <br/><br/>

I have also included my SYSADM1 Portfolio as an overall documentation of my best 3 activities from my First Grading, Midterms, and Finals
