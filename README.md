Shekinah Sotero

My repository consists of one main folder which is the Portfolio folder.
  In my Portfolio folder, it has 3 folders (First Grading, Midterms, and Finals)
    Inside my 3 folders (First Grading, Midterms, and Finals) have another 2 folder (Laboratory and Lecture) that consists all of my activities from Day 1 of this First Semester.

I have also included my SYSADM1 Portfolio as an overall documentation of my best 3 activities from my First Grading, Midterms, and Finals
